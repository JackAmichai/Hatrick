# HatTrick Enhancement TODO List

## Immediate Improvements
- [ ] **Refine Rejection Logic**: The current rejection logic restarts the loop. Consider "guiding" the LLM more explicitly by appending the specific reason for rejection to the prompt history.
- [ ] **Frontend Optimization**: The 3D animations in `ServerTower` and `MITMAnimation` can be optimized for lower-end devices.
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: The current UI is optimized for desktop. Add media queries for better mobile support.

## Feature Suggestions
- [ ] **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow one user to play Red Team and another to play Blue Team via WebSocket rooms.
- [ ] **Persistent Campaign**: Save progress (missions completed, health remaining) to a database (SQLite/Postgres) so users can resume later.
- [ ] **Custom APT Profiles**: Allow users to create their own APT profiles (JSON import) to test against specific custom scenarios.
- [ ] **Reporting Dashboard**: Add a dedicated dashboard route to view past reports generated by `PenTestReportGenerator`.

## Code Quality
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Improve TypeScript types in `useGameSocket.ts` to be more strict about message payloads.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for WebSocket disconnections and LLM API failures.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests for backend `agents.py` logic and frontend React components.
